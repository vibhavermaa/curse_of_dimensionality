# curse_of_dimensionality


## Objective

#### gain understanding of why points are far apart in high dimentional space

See an example of how adding dimensions degrades model performance. find out ways to solve curse of dimensionality in modeling projects

>In high-dimensional space, points tend to be far apart. This impacts data analysis. Intuitively, clustering is difficult when points are far away from each other: >If my next nearest neighbor is very far away, does it still make sense to call it my neighbor?



Let's deep dive into curse of dimensionality issue and understand it better.
